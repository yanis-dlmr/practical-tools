# Profiles

## Introduction

Different profiles are available in the tool. They are generated from parameters and then analysed with the theoretical approach. You can find more information about the theoretical approach in the [theoretical approach](../theoretical-approach/) section.

## Profiles

Different profiles are available in the tool. Each profile is detailed:

- NACA 4-digits profile ([NACA 4-digits](./naca-4-digits/))
- NACA 5-digits profile ([NACA 5-digits](./naca-5-digits/))

## Notations

The notations used in the profiles are detailed:

For the parameters:
- $m$ is the maximum camber of the profile
- $p$ is the position of the maximum camber of the profile
- $t$ is the maximum thickness of the profile in percent of the chord

For the computations:
- $x$ is the abscissa of the point on the profile
- $c$ is the chord of the profile
- $y_c$ is the ordinate of the camber line
- $y_t$ is the ordinate of the thickness line used to generate the profile
- $\theta$ is the angle between the tangent of the camber line and the horizontal axis
- $(x_U, y_U)$ is the point on the upper surface of the profile
- $(x_L, y_L)$ is the point on the lower surface of the profile
- $\alpha$ is the angle of attack

For the output values:
- $C_P$ is the pressure coefficient
- $C_L$ is the lift coefficient
- $C_D$ is the drag coefficient
- $C_M$ is the moment coefficient
