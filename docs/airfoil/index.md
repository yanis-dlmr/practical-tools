# Airfoil analysis

## Introduction

This tool has been developped in order to analyse airfoils through a theorical approach.
Thanks to this tool, you can get the lift, the drag, the moment and the pressure coefficient of an airfoil and compare them to the experimental values.

## Profiles

Different profiles are available in the tool. You can find more information about them in the [profiles](./profiles/) section.

## Theorical approach

Different approaches are used in order to analyse the airfoil. You can find more information about them in the [theorical approach](./theorical-approach/) section.

::: tip Validation of the theorical approach

Please check the validation of the theorical approach in the [theorical approach](./theorical-approach/#validation) section.
