# Airfoil analysis

## Introduction

This tool has been developped in order to analyse airfoils through a theorical approach.
Thanks to this tool, you can get the lift, the drag, the moment and the pressure coefficient of an airfoil and compare them to the experimental values.

## Profiles

Different profiles are available in the tool. You can find more information about them in the [profiles](./profiles/) section.

## Theorical approach

Different approaches are used in order to analyse the airfoil. You can find more information about them in the [theorical approach](./theorical-approach/) section.

## How to use the tool

Just complete the form below and click on the "Calculate" button. You will get the results of the analysis.
Make sure that the values you enter are in the right format.
